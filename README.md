# get-texlive
This script is an automation of the installation process proposed in this [guide](https://www.guitex.org/home/images/ArsTeXnica/AT010/installare%20tex%20live%202010.pdf), with a few adjustments.
This script can also be used later to upgrade TeX Live to the most recent version available (and remove any previously installed distributions).

## Get started
To install/upgrade TeX Live, simply run `get-texlive [ MIRROR_URL ]` (Note: this script needs root privileges).
